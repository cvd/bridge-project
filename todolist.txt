Can we the twitter streams to the site? So that we can insert their twitter
handles and have a feed on each page? I want to get this going on the landing
page from BRIDGE regardless
We need to fix/ update our Twitter page/ using the cool graphics you were
working on at the coffee shop
wordpress blog updates (i was thinking about this--but I would like to link a
different blog in the future)--more details to come.
Tabbed View: Services, Volunteer opportunities, Research Opportunities---this
will expand the views into different tabs instead of all on the same page.
Honey's List: Social Services Craigslist---apparently MoochList exists (but I
do not think they have any data populated)--it would be cool to think about
integration though and the pooling of our assets across the homeless community.
Putting all of the services that population from a search in a long list
instead of multiple pages so they can all show up on the map at the same time.
Different colored markers for different types of services/ categories
Add the Volunteer and Research Opportunities forms to the backend
Add placeholder text to the search box on the home page (e.g. Street Address,
City, State)
On BRIDGE 2.0--log-in with saved search capabilities
Internal Notes for Community of Hope--log-ins for nonprofits using the portal
now?
